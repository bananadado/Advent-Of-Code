Solutions for 2023 :)
ALL in python (I'm bored of C#)

Note:
I didn't end up uploading solutions from day 21 onwards (day 21 was absolutley insane) as the refactor was long and I wasn't too bothered at the time (and then i subsequently forgot) and now my sister has completely destroyed my tower pc in such a way i have no idea how to revive so the solutions are gone :( 

I may or may not come back and redo solutions in the future. Day 21 has me very scared.
