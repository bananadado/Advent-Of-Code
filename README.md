My solutions for AoC 2022

Some solutions are good, most are not (I could make them better but I went for speed and so did the first thing that I thought of).
Some solutions may only have a part 2 if I couldn't be bothered to rewrite part 1 ðŸ‘´

Also a mishmash of python and C#: I tried to use C# as much as possible as I am currently learning it.
