# Advent-Of-Code-2022
My solutions for AoC 2022

Some solutions are good, most are not (I could make them better but I went for speed and so did the first thing that I thought of).
Some solutions may only have a part 2 if I couldn't be bothered to rewrite part 1 👴 (I'll leave a comment within the code itself). All my input files I named "input.txt".

Also a mishmash of python and C#: I tried to use C# as much as possible as I am currently learning it.

Note: The tierlist was created by both @flameded and I. Bfs = B tier, sorry for confusion (too much bfs this year)
